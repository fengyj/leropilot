Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Short summary
- License: The project is licensed under AGPLv3.
- CLA required: All contributors must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
  so the project maintainers can relicense or offer commercial licenses in the future.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your feature/fix.
2. Open a Pull Request describing your changes.
3. Ensure tests pass and include any necessary documentation updates.

CLA requirement
- Before your PR can be merged you must accept/sign the CLA in `cla/CLA.md`.
- You can sign the CLA by either:
  - Adding a short comment to your pull request with the line:
    "I accept the CLA (Contributor License Agreement) for my contributions to this project."
    and including your full name and email; or
  - Following the CLA process if the project later integrates a CLA management service.

Why the CLA?
- The project uses AGPLv3 and the maintainers plan to offer commercial licensing.
- To allow the maintainer(s) to issue a commercial license covering all code,
  contributors must grant the maintainers the rights necessary to relicense
  their contributions under different terms.

Code of Conduct
- Please be respectful and follow standard open-source community guidelines.

If you have any questions about contributing or the CLA, please contact the project owner.
