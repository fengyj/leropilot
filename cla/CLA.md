Contributor License Agreement (CLA) - Simple

By signing this Contributor License Agreement, you confirm the following:

1. You are the author of the Contribution or you have the right to make the
   Contribution under this agreement.
2. You grant to the project maintainer(s) a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to use,
   reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution and such
   derivative works in any form and under any license (including proprietary
   licenses).
3. You agree that the project maintainer(s) may relicense your Contribution
   under a commercial or other license, without further notice to you.

Signing the CLA
- To sign, either:
  - Add a comment to your Pull Request with the text:
    "I accept the CLA (Contributor License Agreement). Name: <Your Full Name>, Email: <your-email>"
  - OR create an issue linking your PR and post the signed text there.

Important notes
- By signing, you are not transferring ownership of your copyright to the
  maintainer(s). You are granting the license above to enable commercial
  licensing and dual-licensing of the project.

or consult a lawyer to draft a CLA tailored to your legal jurisdiction.)
